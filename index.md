Some people might figure out how to decipher it fairly easily (especially because of the `|:` and `:|`), but the source of
the deciphered stuff is from a relatively unknown source, as far as I know. And in case you're wondering, the actual
"encoding" if that's what you call it is not something you'd be able to look up, because I mostly made it up.
