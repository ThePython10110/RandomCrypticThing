## I will be extremely impressed if anyone on the internet figures out where this comes from.
If you want me, a random person you don't know, to be impressed by something you have done, figure it out, and then I will be impressed.

Some people might figure out how to decipher it fairly easily (especially because of the `|:` and `:|`), but the source of
the deciphered stuff is from a relatively unknown source, as far as I know. And in case you're wondering, the actual
"encoding" if that's what you call it is not something you'd be able to look up, because I mostly made it up.

Here are a few simpler ones:

`118 5  $ 4 # 1#4` (I don't like how it starts on 1, but it doesn't fit the other way).

`|:6  6  8 9 6  6  5 % :|`

`6.8.9.(.9.8.6.....576`
